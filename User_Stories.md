**Part 1:**
As a professor, I want to easily capture the notes I write on my whiteboard so that my students can access all of the course material.

As a remote class teacher, I want to be able to write on a whiteboard, so that my students can see all of the lecture notes and not just powerpoint slides.

As a math professor, I want to be able to capture the equations and symbols I write on my chalkboard instead of typing them up, so that my students can access all of the material.

As a student, I wish my professor would record all of the information they write on the whiteboard, so that I can have all of the course materials available to me. 

As a student, I want to be able to save certain slides and notes that would otherwise be erased.

**Part 2:**

**Design level 1-**
In this diagram, the user needs a way to capture the whiteboard for their students, so they use our product.

**Design level 2-**
This diagram shows the users need for this application, then the user uses the application, the user then provides a link so that students can access the application, the students then record the notes of their choice.
